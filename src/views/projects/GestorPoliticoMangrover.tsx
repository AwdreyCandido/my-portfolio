              Gestor Politico Mangrover provides functionalities for team and
              member management, making it easy to organize and keep track of
              registered individuals. It also includes marketing features such

              In addition, the CRM offers informative graphs and charts,
              enabling politicians to analyze data and gain insights into their
              campaign performance. This data-driven approach helps them make

              Another notable feature of GPM is the inclusion of sponsorship
              links. These links facilitate the process of connecting with
              potential voters by allowing politicians to share personalized
              URLs that can be easily distributed through various channels. This
              feature aims to expand their voter base and increase their
              outreach.
